Whether we wanted it or not we've stepped into war with the Cabal on Mars.
So let's get to taking out their command one by one
Valus Ta'aruc.
From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an imperial land
tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected but with the right team we can
break through those defenses, take this beast out and breakn their grip on Freehold.

Tankis has no house. He kneels before no banner.
Owes allegiance to no kell. He is a murderer and very good at what he does.
I have been traking him since wolves broke their chains, yes?
Now Taniks hunts for wolf pack, but not for long.
